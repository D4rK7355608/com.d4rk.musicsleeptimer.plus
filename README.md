## Set your music to stop after you fall asleep.

Just a simple app to stop your music or podcasts after you fall asleep. When the timer stops, audio playback is gradually lowered then paused. üò¥

1. Add the Tile in the Quick Settings panel; ‚öôÔ∏è
2. Tap the Tile to start a timer; üëÜüèº
3. Extend, reduce or cancel the timer with the notification actions. üí§

Prevent your battery from draining! üì±
At the end of the timer, the music is stopped to prevent your phone from playing music all night and draining the battery. üîã

Works with ALL media players! üì±
Works with Spotify, YouTube or any other media player that you love. Simply start the music from your favorite music app, and set the timer. üé∂

Control it from the Notification Center! üì±
Want to listen a little bit longer? ‚è≤Ô∏èWith Music Sleep Timer you can easily extend your timer directly from the Notification Center. üîâ

There are some great alternatives out there, but they all have the same major flaw. üëÄYou shouldn't have to search for an app and wait for it to open to manage your time tracking. With Music Sleep Timer, now you don't have to! üòÉ

Designed with simplicity in mind to make sure it‚Äôs simple to use.
