## Set your music to stop after you fall asleep. 💤

Are you tired of waking up in the middle of the night to find that your phone's battery has drained and your music is still playing? Music Sleep Timer Plus is here to solve that problem. Our app is designed to help you fall asleep to your favorite tunes, podcasts, and other audio content, without worrying about your phone battery lasting through the night.

With Music Sleep Timer Plus, it's easy to set a timer to turn off your audio playback at a specific time. All you need to do is tap the notification tile, select your desired time, and start the countdown. The timer will run in the background, and you can continue to use your phone or other apps as usual. When the timer ends, audio playback will be stopped automatically, ensuring that your phone is conserving energy and you can get a peaceful night's sleep.

But Music Sleep Timer Plus is more than just a sleep timer. It's also a lightweight, efficient app that won't drain your phone's resources or slow it down. And because it's compatible with all media players, you can use it with Spotify, YouTube, and any other app you love.

So if you want an easy way to make sure your music or podcasts don't keep playing all night, give Music Sleep Timer Plus a try. Get a better night's sleep with our app.
